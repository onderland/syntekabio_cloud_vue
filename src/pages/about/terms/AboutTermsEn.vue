                    CLOUD Services to Subscriber or any other Authorized User is
                    prohibited by applicable law; (ii) any vendor of Provider
                    has suspended or terminated Provider’s access to or use of
                    any third-party services or products required to enable
                    Subscriber to access the STB CLOUD Services; or (iii) in

                    subclause (i), (ii), or (iii), a “Service Suspension”).
                    Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
                    provide written notice of any Service Suspension to
                    Subscriber and to provide updates regarding resumption of
                    access to the STB CLOUD Services following any Service
                    Suspension. Provider shall use commercially reasonable
                    efforts to resume providing access to the STB CLOUD Services
                    as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise
                    to the STB CLOUD Services Suspension is cured. Provider will
                    have no liability for any damage, liabilities, losses
                    (including any loss of or profits), or any other
                    consequences that Subscriber or any other Authorized User
                    may incur as a result of a Service Suspension.

                  and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or
                  (ii) to establish a party’s rights under these Terms &

                  party’s obligations of non-disclosure with regard to

                  constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable
                  law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the
                  termination or expiration of these Terms & Conditions for as
                  long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade
                  secret protection under applicable law.
